IMC Login Math Check is a lightweight and privacy-friendly way to protect your WordPress login page from automated bots.   It adds a simple math question (e.g., `3 + 4 = ?`) to the login form, only allowing answers between **0 and 10**.   No external services, no tracking, and no unnecessary complexity.
